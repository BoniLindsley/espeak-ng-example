# eSpeak NG example

Apply text-to-speech to a predetermined text and plays it as audio.


## Purpose

The [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng)
text-to-speech library
does not have an explicit documentation.
While the header for the eSpeak API contains some comments
on how to use the API,
there are none available for the eSpeak NG API,
and new developers are referred to the source code of `espeak-ng` binary.

This repository is my attempt to understand
the basic usage of the eSpeak NG API.
